        <p>Hi folks! I welcome you to my world, a world where the main character (played by me), explores and enjoys the world around her. 
            The story is adventurous, with challenges and taks, but she comes out victorious every single time. Feel free to browse through 
            my projects done on various language, my hobbies and interests, extra curriculars and so much more. And if you want to reach out

            <p>Being a designing and coding enthusiast, I have crearted some projects that have interested me a lot. Being Machine Learning or web
                development, I have always tried to learn new things. some of them includes <b><i>Digit Recognition using speech</i></b>(intern, IIT Guwahati),
                <b><i>Rock-paper-scissor model</i></b> (using python), <b><i>Hangman game </i></b>(using python) , <b><i>Webpages</i></b> And 
                so on.

            <br>
            <p>I have always been a music girlie. Being singing songs to listening them in full blast, I enjoy any kind of music. along with that,
                I love the art of creation, being creating projects from scratch or making best out of waste. I have also started to paint 
                recently and have loved it. Travelling is my passion; I feel alive the most, making me reconnect to myself. My love for maa's hand cooked 
                food is something else. To sum up, music, art, travelling and food-gobling are my priced possessions!

            <br>
            <p>Extra curriculars are equally important as technicall skills, as they help us to gain more and more skills alkike. being a quick learner,
                I have taken part in many extra curriculars and have gain so much. I have served as the head girl of my school, have completed <b><i>Visharad degree </i></b>
                in Indian Classical Music, taken part in some singing compitions (winning some) and so much more!
